## ✨ Features Implemented Beyond Original Scope

This project includes several production-quality features that go beyond the original requirements, demonstrating a deeper understanding of application architecture and user needs.

- **Full CRUD for Word Sub-collections**  
  Provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for a word’s descriptions and examples.

- **Tiered Admin Roles (`super-admin`)**  
  Only `super-admin` users can promote/demote other admins, ensuring secure admin control.

- **Complete Student Management Lifecycle**

  - **Assign Student**: `POST /admin/students/{id}`
  - **List Assigned Students**: `GET /admin/students`
  - **Remove Student**: `DELETE /admin/students/{id}`

- **Robust Business Logic**  
  Prevents invalid states (e.g., assigning an admin as a student to another admin).

- **Detailed User Score History**  
  `GET /users/me/score-history` exposes a full audit trail of score changes.

- **Atomic Operations for Data Integrity**  
  Uses Firestore Transactions (`@firestore.transactional`) for consistency in critical operations.

- **Resilient Self-Healing Data**  
  Automatically regenerates `userCode` if missing, ensuring uninterrupted user experience.
